Creating a docker container called nginx-aap-bind using the image called nginx (or using the nginx image).
In the command, we are doig a mount bind by mouut binding the usr/share/nginx/html directory from nginx to the 
current local directory that we are curretly on.
Thus we are mounting the /usr/share/nginx/html directory by binding it to the current local directory that we're on.

usage:
1. mount is a tag --mount
2. type is the type of mount which is bind : type=bind
3. source is where on the host machine do you want to bind to the container. 
Could be a directory like /home/lin/DevCenter/nginx-app-bind - using "$(pwd)" meaning you want to bind the current directory
4. target is the where you want to bind the host machine dorectory to in the container dorectory 


docker container run -d --name nginx-app-bind -p 8080:80 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/usr/share/nginx/html nginx


docker container run -d --name myapp-bind -p 8080:80 --mount type=bind,source=/home/lin/DevCenter/myapp-bind--dir,target=/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
